# Module One Challenge

## Refactoring

The included website is a refactor of a purposely developed website designed for the Module One Challenge.
The challenge was to refactor the code to make it more accessible by following the below request from the user:

>"AS A marketing agency
>
>I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
>SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"


I have put into practice what I have developed and researched in the Bootcamp so far.
