# Module One Challenge

## Refactoring

The included website is a refactor of a purposely developed website designed for the Module One Challenge.
The challenge was to refactor the code to make it more accessible by following the below request from the user:

>"AS A marketing agency
>
>I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
>SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"

I have put into practice what I have learnt in the bootcamp so far. I have also included a few features that I have researched out of hours.

My motivation for this project and the course in general was to change careers. I am currently an IT Engineer working for the NHS and have wanted to make a break into software development for a while. No other hobby or skill gives me such satisfaction.

This is my 4th project on GitHub but the first one that focuses on a strict want or requirement from a customer.

## Challenges

### Deciding whether to structure certain elements as sections or articles / aside elements
I ended up opting for nesting sections within articles and aside elements. I felt that as long as the root element was an article or aside, the section element is much more diverse so probably the safer option.

### Cleaning up the CSS
Tidying up a lot of the CSS forced me to intesnley examine the website through the inspect element. A lot of the elements were being targeted by different selectors. I had to make sure each selector was covered to avoid any loss of formatting. I managed to clean a lot of it up by including multiple selectors on the same line. A lot of the CSS was targeting an element within another element. While my CSS looked and functioned OK, I'm sure there's an easier and more efficent way of targeting those selectors.

### To Comment or Not to Comment
I like to think most of the class and ID names are self explanatory and I have changed some to make it more obvious. While the assignment was to make the webpage more accessible for end users, I figure it should be more accessible for other developers too.
